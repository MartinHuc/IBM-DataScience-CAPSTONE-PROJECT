# IBM-DataScience-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
## Project background and context

This project is the final part of IBM Data Science Professional Course. Which aims to demonstrate knowledge of fundamental data science concepts like data gathering, manipulation and visualization and ability to formulate outcomes from given data.

In this capstone project, we will try to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars what is well bellow other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 

## Problems we want to find answers for...
 What are the factors increasing probability of successful  first stage landing?
 Can we build a predictive model to help us predict if the landing will be successful?
 Are there features that currently used launch sites have in common?
